<h1><strong>Josephine Butler College Kitchen and Coffee Shop</strong></h1><p>Josephine Butler College has its own <strong>Coffee Shop</strong> and <strong>Kitchen</strong> in the College Bar, serving food and drinks daily. See below for the choices on our menus.</p><p>The <strong>Library&nbsp;</strong>is located in the IT Suite. You can request books to be added to the college library which are not currently available there by asking the Coffee Shop staff.&nbsp;Unfortunately, if you have any Library fines these can only be paid and dealt with at the Main Library. Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.</p><p>If you have any comments or suggestions, please contact <strong>Rebecca Teece</strong>&nbsp;or <strong>Vicky Ribbons </strong>(right).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>MENUS</h1><h3>Coffee Shop<img src="http://community.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/application/views/services/img/upload/008.jpg" alt="" /></h3><p><img src="http://community.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/application/views/services/img/upload/009.jpg" alt="" /></p><h3>Kitchen</h3><p><img src="http://community.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/application/views/services/img/upload/010.jpg" alt="" /></p><p><img src="http://community.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/application/views/services/img/upload/011.jpg" alt="" /></p><p><img src="http://community.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/application/views/services/img/upload/012.jpg" alt="" /></p>
