<h2>Moving Into your new House!<br /></h2><p>Moving into your new house can be a stressful, but if you follow some of these guidelines, take your time and use your common sense you should get through the process easily enough! Remember, this is your home for the next year so don't accept anything less than a home and treat it as such!</p><p>The following points should help you settle in:</p><p><ul><li>Make sure you are given keys to all the doors in your property and that you have enough sets for everyone.</li><li>Check the house is in the standard you expect it to be. For example, if the landlord has said they will get it cleaned, have they?</li><li>Take meter readings for Gas, Electric and Water (where applicable) as soon as the first person gets into the property. It is VERY important you tell your providers this reading so that you are not paying for the previous tennants' usage.</li><li>Check the contents of your house against the inventory. If you haven't been given an inventory, your landlord should be more than happy to give you one. It is important that any discrepancies between the itinerary and your property are rectified quickly in order to avoid difficulties when trying to get your deposit back at the end of the year.</li><li>Check your house for damages straight away. Any damages you do find, photograph it and send them to your landlord. Again this is to stop you from getting the blame at the end of the year and losing your deposit.</li><li>Check that you know how your fire alarms work. When you burn your toast you need to know how not to cause panic.</li><li>Make sure all locks work and that you know your alarm codes. Students can sometimes be targets so it is important that you are as secure as possible. I would recommend that you take out possessions insurance.</li><li>Buy a TV Licence (if you want to watch TV that is!)</li><li>Meet your neighbours. A good rapport from the beginning will make communications easier if you ever have problems with them or they have problems with you. Remember to be considerate and keep noise to a minimum.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
