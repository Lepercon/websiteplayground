<h2>House Hunting Talk, 'Find A Housemate' nights and Where butlerites Live!</h2><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">Late in Michaelmas term, there will be a talk held in the bar regarding accommodation options for the coming year.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #595959; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; mso-themecolor: text1; mso-themetint: 166;">Whether you&rsquo;re thinking of living in college, or moving down into town, you can pop along and hear advice and pointers from the DSU Accommodation Office, and get some valuable opinions from people who&rsquo;ve lived both in and out. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #595959; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; mso-themecolor: text1; mso-themetint: 166;">Where you&rsquo;re living is only one aspect of finding a house though; probably the most important thing to get sorted is who you&rsquo;ll actually be living with. It&rsquo;s incredibly easy to get caught up in the panic of looking for a house incredibly early, and as a result you may make rash decisions on who you agree to move in with. Make sure you feel comfortable with everyone you plan on living with, and if you have any doubts then don&rsquo;t commit yourself straight away. This will be a big part of the DSU's "Take Your Time To Sign" campaign which is running throughout November. Remember, it's the people, not the place!</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #595959; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; mso-themecolor: text1; mso-themetint: 166;">If it gets to a point where you have no idea who you want to live with, or still need a housemate to fill that one empty room in your dream house, then both the college and the DSU run &lsquo;Find A Housemate&rsquo; nights where you can meet other people looking to Live Out. Keep your eyes peeled for more information nearer the time!</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="color: #595959; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; mso-themecolor: text1; mso-themetint: 166;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><br /><img style="margin: 10px auto; display: block;" src="http://www.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/application/views/liversout/img/upload/023.jpg" alt="" /></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Butlerites live all over Durham!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
