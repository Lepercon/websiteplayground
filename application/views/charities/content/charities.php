<h1>Charity Work&nbsp;at Josephine Butler College</h1><h3>What Do We Do?</h3><p>At Josephine Butler College we always love helping people out, which extends to all of&nbsp;the Charity work and events that we put on.&nbsp;During the year we are planning to run some&nbsp;exciting events which we would love you to get&nbsp;involved in! These include: Dare Night, where we&rsquo;ll&nbsp;have you running around the College and the&nbsp;University getting up to mischief; Charity Auctions,&nbsp;where you&rsquo;ll be sure to grab a great prize; and&nbsp;&lsquo;Butler&rsquo;s Got Talent&rsquo;, our incredible show where&nbsp;you&rsquo;ll be able to show everybody your amazing&nbsp;unique talent.</p><h3>What is Grace House?</h3><p>Grace House is a local children&rsquo;s hospice, which&nbsp;provides support for terminally ill children in the North East of England. A few years ago&nbsp;as a college we decided we wanted to support them in the development and running of&nbsp;the centre. Since then we have raised many thousands of pounds for Grace House. We&nbsp;hope to continue to work with the hospice, providing funds and volunteers necessary for&nbsp;to continue to operate.</p><p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/t31.0-8/10272678_10152682974728848_2877571512447080508_o.jpg" alt="" width="606" height="404" /></p><h3>What is DUCK?</h3><p>DUCK stands for Durham University Charity &lsquo;Kommittee&rsquo;. They run lots of big charitable&nbsp;events from volunteering abroad to sponsored skydives. Although you often have you&nbsp;raise your own sponsorship for these events, they can&nbsp;be really fun and rewarding to get involved in.</p><h3>How Can I Get Involved?</h3><p>We would love you to get involved in our events. You&rsquo;ll hear loads of information about them during the year, so please come along and support our great cause. We would also love your help organising and running&nbsp;events, and coming up with ideas for new ones.&nbsp;</p><p>Please come along to Charity Comm, which meets at&nbsp;5pm on Wednesdays in the bar.
