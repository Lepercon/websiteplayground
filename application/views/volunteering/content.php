<h2>Projects Committee.</h2>
<p>Projects Committee is the name given to Butlers committee that helps run and find new ways in which students from Butler can give back to the communities around them. Students give up their time all year round to work with our Projects Comm. volunteering initiatives. Projects are a really great way to make a difference in the local community. We’ve got a really successful scheme with a local primary school, and so many more volunteering opportunities! Interested? If you have any projects you are passionate about or would like to start up please contact either your Vice-President or the College Chaplain.</p>
