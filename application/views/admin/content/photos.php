<h2>Viewing Photos</h2>
<h3>On the Media Page</h3>
<p>The media page contains both photos and videos. Videos can be viewed on the JCR website but must be uploaded to the JCR YouTube account. Photos are sorted by academic year and grouped into events and are uploaded from the events page.</p>

<h3>On the Event Information Page</h3>
<p>Clicking on an event in the calendar will open the event information page. On this page there is a box for event photos. Any photos currently uploaded for the event will be shown as thumbnails.</p>

<h3>Viewing Large Versions</h3>
<p>Clicking on a photo thumbnail will open a larger version of the image. Use the next/previous buttons or right/left keyboard arrows to move through the photos of an event. Photo albums can be downloaded as a zip file from the media or event page.</p>

<h2>Uploading Photos</h2>
<p>If you are logged in to the JCR website, you can add new photos by clicking 'Upload a photo for this event' at the bottom of the photos box on an event page. Firstly, choose the file which you would like to upload. As an option, you can give the photo a brief description of up to 200 characters in length. Click 'Add Photo' to upload it. After uploading, a message will be shown at the top of the page which will be green if successful and red in the event of a failure. Reasons for failure can include that the file was not the correct format (jpg/png), it was too large (must be less than 8MB) or that the connection failed during the upload. When uploading a photo please ensure that you have permission from the owner of the image to do so. After uploading an image, you can either upload another or go back to the event information page.</p>

<h2>Managing Photos</h2>
<p>If you are logged in and are an administrative user you can manage uploaded photos. If an event already has photos uploaded to it, you can manage those photos from the event information page. Click 'manage photos' at the bottom of the photos box. On this page, admin can delete photos individually and add, edit or remove descriptions.</p>
