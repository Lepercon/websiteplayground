<h2>Signup permissions</h2><p>Anyone with a JCR role (if they're on the Who's Who pages) can create a signup. It should be noted that only the webmaster, JCR President, JCR Vice president and social chair have permissions to edit all signups.</p><h2>Creating a signup</h2><p>To create a signup, click the event on the calendar that you would like to create a signup for. Then, in the signup box of the event information page, choose to 'create a signup for this event'.</p><p>The form which appears contains five sections to guide you through the process of creating a signup. Information specific to each field of the form can be found by hovering over them; this will tell you the character limit on the field, whether it is required or not and in some cases, specific ways to enter the information.</p><p>In the first section the signup name, event time and signup opening and closing times are compulsory. For the dates, use the drop down datepicker if possible to select a date, if that does not appear then enter dates in the format DD/MM/YYYY. The pickup locations list is optional and should be separated with commas for each entry, eg "Location 1, Location 2, Location 3". The options from this list will be shown when the user is entering their group names and food preferences during the booking process.&nbsp;<span style="background-color: transparent;">The number of signup sets means that a single user can make the selected number of sets of bookings. A set consists of up to 4 bookings.</span></p><p>The permissions section allows you to add an extra role which can have admin privileges on the particular signup. If you are creating a signup and would not normally have full access, you must set this to your own role or you will not be able to access the signup which you created.</p><p>The table and group options box allows you to select whether a signup is for tables for a meal or groups for coaches for example. This makes no difference other than the wording that is used. The number of tables/groups and the size of those tables/groups must be set.&nbsp;</p><p>In the food choices box, the list of options available for the starter, main, desert and drinks can be put in a comma separated list as with the pickup locations list.</p><p>The seat swapping box is for use in formals where users can swap seats after signing up. This is generally done at an extra cost to the person invoking the swap so there is a price field and also the times for swapping to open and close. Swapping can be run concurrently with signup but should not open until a while after signup has opened so that most of the seats are booked already. Enter a value in the price field to activate the function.</p><h2>Managing a signup</h2><h3>Changing signup information</h3><p>You can edit information about a signup by choosing 'edit signup' from the admin box at the bottom of the page on the left hand side of a signup. This presents you with the same form that creating a signup does only the information for the relevant signup will have been filled in already.</p><h3>Deleting signed up people</h3><p>Hover over the name of the person you wish to remove from the signup in the list of tables. A small cross will appear at the right of their name. Click this cross and confirm the action to delete their booking.</p><h3>Attendee Information</h3><p>In the admin box on the signup page there are links to view an attendee table and view catering numbers. The attendee table shows a list of bookings sorted by table number. The catering numbers page calculates how many requests there are per table for each type of food and drink as well as showing the overall totals.</p><h3>Cancelling a signup</h3><p>This is done from the admin box on the signup page. It will delete the signup along with the list of all bookings and any seat swaps. Use this with caution!</p>
