<h2>Admin</h2><p>When you are logged in and have administrative rights, you can click the 'website admin' link below your name in the site header. This will take you to a page with 5 administrative functions on it:</p><h3>Edit roles</h3><p>This is a large webpage containing all the roles in college and the people in them, people can be transferred between being in and out of a role. There is no limit to the number of roles that an individual can have. Role names can be changed but this should be avoided. Full site access means that a user with the role has admin rights so can access the administrative pages of the site. The level type refers to where on the who's who pages the role will appear.</p><h3>Page Editing</h3><p>This is where the roles who can edit certain pages are set. Each page which has editable content has a section on this page. Roles can be moved between the columns using the arrow buttons to allow or disallow editing to a particular role.</p><h3>Synchronise</h3><p>Run this at the start of August to remove all graduating students and again at the end of September to import all Freshers from the database. This process will also update everyone's names to match the name they have in the university database as some people change a name during their time at university.</p><h3>Categories</h3><p>A category list is used when creating events and project requests to help with sorting them. Categories can be added, renamed and removed from this list. Categories which match a page name of the website such as 'alumni' and 'bar' should not be altered as they can affect what content appears on those pages.</p><h3>Site cleanup</h3><p>This should be run once a year after doing a synchronisation to clear the photos of people who have left the college</p>
