<h2>INTERNATIONAL awareness</h2><p>Butler is such a diverse community, and it is important to appreciate and acknowledge this diversity represented by Butlerites! As a college, we are proud to provide strong support for the international community. One World Week, dedicated to celebrating multicultural diversity and championing international voices, is just one example of such support.</p><p ><img src="http://community.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/application/views/international/img/upload/002.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="130" />&nbsp;Henna tattoos in the Bar to celebrate Diwali</p><p>International Committee organises events to raise multicultural awareness and enhance the international aspect of college life.
