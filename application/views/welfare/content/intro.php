<p>Hey Guys, We are <strong>Fiona</strong>, <strong>Laura</strong>, <strong>Chloe,</strong> <strong>Billy </strong>and<strong> Laurie:</strong>&nbsp;your Welfare team!</p><p><br />As the Welfare team we offer a confidential, non-advisory listening service that is completely unbiased. We can also give information about University and Local services, so can point you in the direction of people who can help. &nbsp;<br />The services we provide to support you are&nbsp;<strong>p</strong><strong>op-ins</strong>, <strong>welfare mobile</strong>, <strong>welfare email </strong>and <strong>anonymous supplies</strong>.<br /><br /></p><p><strong>Pop-ins</strong> are run weekly and are&nbsp;an hourly session where you can drop in to see a member of the Welfare team. You can come to talk, get information or pick up supplies.&nbsp;More information can be found under the drop in option on the Welfare section of the website.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>welfare mobile</strong> is on every night of term between 8pm-10pm. You can ring the Welfare mobile to talk to one of the Welfare team or to arrange to meet one of us outside the Drop-in time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>welfare email</strong>&nbsp;is designed&nbsp;for you to get in touch with us, without having to come to a drop-in or ring the mobile. You can email us anonymously from the JCR website and one of the welfare team will respond as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Anonymous supplies requests</strong> can be placed on the website. For more information and to request safe sex supplies click on the 'Free Supplies Form' option.</p><p><br />You'll see us all about College regularly, so please don't hesitate to get in touch! <br />The Welfare team :)<br /><br /><strong>Welfare Mobile:</strong> <em>07902292931</em> (Every night of term- 8-10pm).<br /><strong>Welfare email:</strong> <em>butler.welfare@durham.ac.uk</em>.<br /><br /></p><p>JCR Welfare Officer: Fiona Hathaway</p><p>Assistant welfare officers:&nbsp;Billy Errington, Laura Marriot, Laurie Hill and&nbsp;Chloe O'Connor</p>
