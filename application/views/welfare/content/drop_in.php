<p>Pop-ins run weekly throughout term-time, where Butlerites can see a member of the welfare team to discuss any problems they are facing and to request information about more support within college, university or in the community. Safe-sex supplies can also be requested during drop-in times to be retrieved there and then.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><p>Please be aware that although each member of the welfare team aims to help every student through any issues they are facing, the welfare team cannot offer advice. However, we are an excellent shoulder to cry on or person to rant to.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you would like to see a member of the welfare team but the drop-in times are not convenient please email or ring the welfare mobile to organise a time that is convenient for you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pop-in times (2014-15):</strong> 12-1 Mondays</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes drop-ins will take place outside of College primarily to cater for livers-out. To find out more about these drop-ins keep an eye out on the livers-out and JCR facebook pages, or get in touch with a member of the welfare team.</p>
