<h1><strong>Upcoming WELFARE Campaigns 2014/2015</strong></h1><h3>Butlerite Welfare Week</h3><p>All about the welfare of every Butlerite. This campaign aims to ensure that Freshers are settling into university life, that new livers-out are settling into their new houses and that all other students are also feeling comfortable for the academic year. The main point of the campaign will be to alert all students about the Welfare team's role in college and know that welfare is something that affects everyone, so get involved!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Healthy Body, Healthy Mind</strong></h3><p>We are a self-catered college - yay! However, due to the fact that we cook for ourselves means that healthy eating is even more important for us. This campaign aims to ensure that Butlerites are aware of what they are eating, and given information that will help encourage healthy eating.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Know Your Limits&nbsp;</h3><p>This campaign is all about dealing with primarily drinking&nbsp;in university life. It has no aim to put students off drinking, however, it aims to make students aware of the risks of drinking, giving information on ensuring personal safety and maybe even some hangover recipes for those headaches the morning after nights out. However, with welfare comm's help it will also aim to provide information on other outlets where students may require some support in understanding the limits, e.g. gambling, social media, smoking etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Mental Health and Disability Awareness&nbsp;</h3><p>To raise awareness about groups normally stigmatised in everyday life. All statistics and facts are important about groups of people who have disabilities that result in discrimination. This campaign aims to go further than bringing these facts to the forefront by hopefully making Butlerites more aware of stigma and discrimination and ensuring that we are an even more inclusive college. This is an extended week as there is so much that can be covered.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Sexual Health Awareness and Guidance Week (SHAG)</h3><p>Ensuring that Butlerites are aware about sexual health&nbsp;and sexual identity. This week aims to promote safe sex and aims to inform Butlerites about STIs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Take a Break&nbsp;</h3><p>A six-week campaign from the end of the Easter Holidays to the end of the exam period. This campaign is provided to ensure that there are relaxing activities so that revision and deadlines do not cause too much stress, during this busy period.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Past Booklets:</h3><h2><a class="no-jsify" href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/application/views/welfare/doc/shag_booklet.pdf">shag WEEK booklet.pdf</a></h2><h2><a class="no-jsify" href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/application/views/welfare/doc/stressless_booklet.pdf">stressless booklet.pdf</a></h2>
