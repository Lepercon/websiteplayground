<p>At Butler we try to make sport as inclusive as possible from everyone. We have a wide range of clubs, ranging from the traditional to ones that you may have never tried before! Getting involved in a sports club is one of the best ways to meet new people in college, and all clubs are welcoming of new members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Any queries please contact me on: <a href="mailto:daniel.mcelhone@durham.ac.uk">daniel.mcelhone@durham.ac.uk</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
