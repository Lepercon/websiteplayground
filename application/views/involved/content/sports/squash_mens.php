<p>Who wouldn't want a hit a ball at a wall repeatedly?&nbsp; With the Squash team, you can&nbsp;even hit balls against walls with other people!&nbsp;We field 2 teams, a Men's 6 and a Women's 6. Normally a training session a week as well as a game every weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>All levels of play welcome!</p><p>Men's President:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:t.a.strange@durham.ac.uk">kenny.sangha@durham.ac.uk</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Women's President:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:alexandra.dockreay@durham.ac.uk">n.e.kay@durham.ac.uk</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
