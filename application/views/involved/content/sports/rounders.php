<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rounders is a summer sport at Durham with a small league which consists&nbsp;of&nbsp;mixed teams. Playing once a week on the back field at&nbsp;Butler in the third term, everyone is welcome. It is very relaxed which evokes an excellent opportunity to know everyone else within the college. There will be around 5 or 6 competitive games in the last term as well. The rounders co-president is Sarah Beard who can be contacted at&nbsp;sarah.beard@durham.ac.uk</p>
