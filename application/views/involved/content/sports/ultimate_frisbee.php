<p><br /></p><p>Ultimate is a sport which is unbeknown to many people on arriving at uni and we would like to start by clarifying that it is NOT a lazy sport involving chilling in a field on a sunny summer's afternoon! It is an very active and high paced sport, promoting especially spirit within the Durham Ultimate scene. Teams consist of 7 players on the pitch at one time and have to throw the disc to someone standing in an end zone to score a point - whichever team has the most points at the end wins!&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>All people of all talents are more than welcome to come and play, our taster session this year is Thursday 3rd October at 1pm on the back field at college so please come along and bring as many people as possible! The more, the merrier...</p><p>Here is the info for the club for next year:</p><p>President - Nick Cliffe</p><p>Captain - James Fahy</p><p>Social Sec - Vincent Lim&nbsp;</p><p>Token Good Guy - Carlo Hill</p><p>So if you have questions at all, please don't hesitate to get in touch and we hope to see you soon at the taster session!</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
