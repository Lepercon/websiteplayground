<p>Josephine Butler Football Club is&nbsp;the newest football club in the University, and already one of the most competitive clubs in terms of league positionings and squad strength.</p><p>The Club currently has&nbsp;five 11 a side teams competing across the university leagues. We have an even spread across the divisions with many recent promotions enancing the colleges footballing reputation.&nbsp;We also have an E team which participates in the Friendly League and this provides an opportunity for players to get a less competitive game of football.</p><p>The A team will be hoping to push for promotion back up into the premiership this year and will also be wanting a&nbsp;long run in the floodlit cup to keep the Butler fans happy.&nbsp;The B team will&nbsp;be looking to break more records, with a chance for&nbsp;their 3rd promotion in a row this year, the&nbsp;new leadership of Joe Colebrook will bring a fresh take to the B team and they&nbsp;will be hoping for another successful year.&nbsp;The Cs will&nbsp;be looking for back-to-back promotions after a successful campaign last year. The D and E teams will be hoping for a fresh intake of willing freshers to continue the competitive but friendly spirit they have shown throughout their campaigns.</p><p>We train weekly on the MUGA and this year have been fortunate to secure the use of Maiden Castle's 'Rubber Crumb' which will allow training to occur under floodlights on a Thursday night. There are also plenty of opportunities to get involved with our regular socials with the famous 'Legend's' social always proving one of the most popular. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any questions abotu anythign football related please get in touch:</p><p><a href="mailto:robert.young@durham.ac.uk">robert.young@durham.ac.uk</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CLUB PRESIDENT - ROBERT YOUNG</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A TEAM CAPTAIN - Daniel McElhone</p><p>B TEAM CAPTAIN - Joe Colebrook<br /><br />C TEAM CAPTAIN - Adam Dugdale</p><p>D TEAM CAPTAIN - Lewis Li</p><p>E TEAM CAPTAIN - Richard Meaney</p><p><br />SOCIAL SECRETARIES - Robert Young/Danny Agar</p>
