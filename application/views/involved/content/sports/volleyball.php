<p>Volleyball is a fun and social sport for everyone, irrespective of ability. Whether you've never played before or are an expert in volleyball, we'd love to have you in our club.</p><p>We have weekly practices in the Howlands on Saturdays from 7pm to 9pm, but you're welcome to just come for as long as you like, as often as you like.</p><p>With an inter-college league introduced last year, we will be entering a team again this year. Anyone who is interested can play for college, or you can just come along to the sessions on Saturdays for fun and social practice.</p><p>If you're interested in joining the team you can contact me or Jacob Ireson, our captain, for more information, or just turn up to the practices. Also, if you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to contact me on m.n.stewart@durham.ac.uk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
