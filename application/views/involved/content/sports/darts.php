Each team has 8 players - each player faces off with one on the opposing team for the best of 3 legs. Of course, there's also the beer leg, not only pride but drinks are at stake - the first team to check out from 1001 earns a well-deserved beverage of their choice!&nbsp;Joining one of the teams is a great way to relax and socialise on a Monday evening, and again, no experience (or nickname) is necessary.</p><p>And if you just want to have to odd game, the board in Butler is always free to be used by everyone, so why not grab some darts from behind the bar, try your hand and see if you have what it takes to be the next Phil Taylor!</p><p></p>
