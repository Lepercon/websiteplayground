To suit this wide variety of experience, we have men's and women's competitive racing squads, and social rowing squads.<br /><br />For social rowers, outings can happen as frequently or rarely as needed; provided there are enough people to fill a boat, (four or eight), a coach will be more than happy to take you out.<br />For people looking to get involved in the Racing Squad, training on the river normally happens twice a week, with a further two indoor sessions in the gym working on a rowing machine and general fitness.<br /><br />For anyone new to rowing looking to get involved, the Club and University run a 'Learn2Row' programme, which runs in the First Term and gives Freshers a chance to get some experience on the river and a flavour for the commitment required before signing up on a longer basis. The culmination of this programme is the Novice Cup: a fiercely competitive Inter-College competition, and a great opportunity to sample the electric atmosphere that comes with your first race.<br /><br />If you're interested in getting involved with the Boat Club, or want some more information, please take a look at our website <a href="http://butlerboatclub.wordpress.com">http://butlerboatclub.wordpress.com</a>&nbsp; or contact one of the exec below:<br /><br />Chris Lowans- Club President (<a href="mailto:c.c.lowans@durham.ac.uk">c.c.lowans@durham.ac.uk</a>)<br />Simon Wheeldon&nbsp;- Men's Captain (<a href="mailto:s.wheeldon@durham.ac.uk">s.wheeldon@durham.ac.uk</a>)<br />Rebecca Graham&nbsp;- Women's Captain (<a href="mailto:r.n.graham@durham.ac.uk">r.n.graham@durham.ac.uk</a>)<br />Isobel Turbin&nbsp;- Captain of Coxes (<a href="mailto:i.g.turbin@durham.ac.uk">i.g.turbin@durham.ac.uk</a>)<br /></span></p>
