<p>Arts Committee promote Arts around the College by running weekly classes and sessions. We also help make Butler events look their best by making banners and decorations. Whether we're doing tie-dye, watercolour or sewing, there's always something for everyone, whatever your ability. So please come along, have a chat and get creative!&nbsp;</p>
