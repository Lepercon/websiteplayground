<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 1.231;">Just a group of people hanging out, reading some books and having a chat really. I think we're going to try to provide some copies of what we're reading this year so you don't have to fork out on Amazon, which is nice.&nbsp;</span><br /></p><p>All are welcome regardless of taste, suggestions of what to read next are always appreciated also. As for the future of the society, expect meetings in some lovely Durham pubs and possible outings to local cultural events (Durham Book Festival, Clayport Film Club etc etc).&nbsp;</p><p>If this sounds like your kind of thing then please do sign up at the Freshers' Fair, or feel free to email with any questions. &nbsp;</p>
