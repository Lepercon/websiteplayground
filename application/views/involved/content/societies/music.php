Butlerites are known for being a good audience...</p><p><strong><strong>Entry is £3 for the year</strong></strong>, which covers access to the Music Room and usage of all the college equipment within. We also have socials, often with themes (yes, you've finally got an excuse to wear that Ziggy Stardust costume) and generally keep ourselves busy with concerts and the like.</p><p>Below is a summary of some of the main areas of Music Soc life:</p><p><br /></p><p><u><strong><strong>Butler Jazz Band</strong></strong></u></p><p><strong>The college's flagship band, Butler Jazz Band play numerous concerts throughout the year including Ustinov Summer Ball, the Vice Chancellor's Garden Party, and even the Durham Christmas Markets in the Cathedral and on Palace Green. We're always on the lookout for new talent - if you play brass or woodwind and enjoy playing everything from Glenn Miller to Herbie Hancock to Michael Bublé, then get in touch!</strong></p><p><strong>BAND LEADERS: Owen Franklin</strong></p><p><strong><a href="mailto:owen.franklin@durham.ac.uk">owen.franklin@durham.ac.uk</a></strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p><u>String Group</u></p><p>We are an enthusiastic group of string players, who formed in the autumn of 2009 to create Butler's first String Group! That year we performed at the Alumni formal, as well as at various other events. Last year we played a variety of pieces, including Pachelbel's Canon and the opening to the Spring Movement of Vivaldi's Four Seasons, and performed at numerous college functions. We are buying new music this year and looking to expand our repertoire and gain more performance experience!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong><strong><u>Barbershop Group</u></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Butler Barbershop is a mixed group of a cappella singers consisting of anywhere between 7-11 students. We sing voice-only arrangements of many genres of music, and our repertoire is expanding all of the time. We sing everything from Elton John to Van Morrison to Beyoncé... Many of the arrangements are written by members of the group, and we try to choose a collection of both traditional and untraditional pieces. We aim to make our performances as entertaining as possible through our eclectic setlist and often unorthodox covers!</strong></strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><strong><br /></strong></strong></p><p><u>Open Mic Nights</u></p><p>Held on several Fridays a term, open mic nights at Butler are always well-attended, and not just by Butlerites! These are a chance to cut your teeth playing live to a relaxed and friendly audience, and in the past year alone we've had everything from acoustic ballads to full bands to fiddlers, with the occasional Georgian folk song thrown in (and we mean the country, not the state)! Just turn up on the night and do your thing, or if you need specific requirements (eg: drumkit, keyboards) then email in advance. Budding rockstars and pop idols, this is your moment to shine...</p><p><br /></p><p><u><strong><strong>Woodwind Group</strong></strong></u></p><p><strong><strong>Woodwind Group is perfect for anyone who hasn't played for a few years, or is just looking to have some fun! We have performed at a range of events, including the Durham Christmas Market in the Cathedral and several concerts at Butler. This year we're looking to work on a wider variety of music and play at more events!</strong></strong></p><p>clara.fennessy@durham.ac.uk / catherine.gillott@durham.ac.uk</p><div><p><span style="line-height: 21px; font-size: 20px;" class="Apple-style-span"><strong><span style="font-size: 17px;" class="Apple-style-span"><strong><br /></strong></span></strong></span></p><p></p></div>
