Do you love scoring sweaty goals? Do you love the sound of Geoff Shreeves as he tells us that our star player looks OK and will carry on after severely breaking his leg?</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If your answer to these questions is yes, then you should probably join FifaSoc. Over the course of the year we will be hosting cash tournaments, both singles and doubles tournaments! (at least 1 per term).&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Ther<span >e is no entry fee into FifaSoc, the only money you will pay is the entry fee into the tournaments you want to enter. Anybody can join regardless of ability.
