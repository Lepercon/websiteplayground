<p class="MsoNormal">Welcome to Croquet Society!</p><p class="MsoNormal">Rumour has it we're the fastest growing society in JoBo since the 2014 Freshers Week. Apart from the most talked about social in the college, here's what you're in for.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Just a quick point before we get your hopes up about playing traditional English croquet with tea, crumpets and scones, we do things slightly differently at Butler... In fact, we distort the rules and etiquette of the game so much at times that it probably can&rsquo;t legally still be referred to as &lsquo;croquet&rsquo;. Rather than think of a new name for the &lsquo;sport&rsquo;,however, we have just decided to call it Extreme Croquet &ndash; imagine it like regular croquet, but on crack.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Not quite sure what we mean? Well, for example article K of the All English Lawn Care and Construction Guide states clearly that:</p><p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;The ideal grass surface for croquet is a perfectly level area of even, fine and closely mown grass, as one would expect to find on a first class flat bowling green or tennis court&rdquo;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The picture below shows just how thoroughly we have disregarded this sound advice. Our aim is simple: we play with the standard croquet format but dispense with all sense of limitation. You can hit the ball anywhere. In fact, the more you can screw someone over, the better. The poor man in the picture took over 20 hits just to get back to the &lsquo;legal playing area&rsquo; and nearly got run over by the PR2 bus.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img  src="http://www.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/application/views/involved/img/upload/046.jpg" alt="" /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span >In this particular game, play had to be stopped on occasion when a bus or car got in the way (how thoughtless of the drivers), but usually nothing stops us.&nbsp;</span>We've<span >&nbsp;played in all weathers, from torrential rain to heavy snow. These people below might be soaking wet and about to fall seriously ill,but look how much fun they are having... the guys can&rsquo;t even bring themselves to let go of their balls it&rsquo;s that good!</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img  src="http://www.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/application/views/involved/img/upload/047.jpg" alt="" /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span >So yeah, we might not have done the best job of selling our society to you if you are looking to play croquet as it was intended to be played, but we guarantee that our way is much more fun, especially on the 4 or 5 good days of weather we get up north...</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">In case it wasn&rsquo;t clear from the ridiculous nature of our way of playing, no prior experience or skill of any kind is required, so you have no excuse not to join us!</p>
