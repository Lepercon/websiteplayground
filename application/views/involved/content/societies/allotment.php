<p>Allot Soc.&nbsp;are a laid back&nbsp;society that enjoys planting and growing&nbsp;fruit and veg&nbsp;at college. We have meetings every Wednesday 2-4, at the Allotment, which is located behind Milfield Field.</p><p>The Allotment received a&nbsp;bursary last year which means we&nbsp;now have a shed, greenhouse and a fence, allowing&nbsp;for year round growing of&nbsp;vegetables.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/8/1286544746271/FunnyCarrots(2).jpg"><br /></p>
