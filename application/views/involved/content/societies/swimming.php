Hey!<br /><br />Swimming Society runs sessions once or twice a week where we walk down to the Freeman's Quay swimming pool in town for a swim. <br /><br />Whether you're the next Michael Phelps or you prefer doggy-paddle, all are welcome to join us :) Swimming is great for fitness, and is also a really nice way to chill out after a day of lectures!<div><br /></div><div>Last year we ran sessions on Tuesday evenings, but this year we'll sort out times that work best for everyone.<br /><br />Swimming Soc only started last year, but we're hoping to expand this year with more frequent sessions and hopefully socials too!</div><div><br />Join the facebook group (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/434179403344835/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/434179403344835/</a>) and don't hesitate to get in touch with me via the contact button below!<br /><br />Bill Wright<br /><br /><br /></div>
