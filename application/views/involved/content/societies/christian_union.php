<p class="MsoNormal">Butler Christian Union exists to bring the Gospel of Jesus to those within Josephine Butler and to encourage one another through regular meetings in living for Jesus. We meet every Friday&nbsp;evening at&nbsp; in the Howlands Quiet Room at 18:45&nbsp;and then&nbsp;move to Christian Union's Central meeting in the DSU at 20:00 (ignore the information about stating it's on Tuesday!!)</p><p class="MsoNormal">We put on events throughout the term and would dearly love you to come along no matter what your opinions of Christianity.</p>
