We aim to unite all pudding lovers and encourage everyone to get baking! To be a member of our society you do not have to be a great baker, all you need is to have a passion for puddings! Pudding society is just a great way to meet up weekly, eat lots of cake and have fun!</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-GB" style="font-weight: bold;">What We Do</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-GB">Every week members take it in turns to produce a pudding which is then tasted and judged by the rest of the society. The winner then progresses to our&nbsp;end of the term in our "bake off". At the end of each meeting when the weekly winner has been decided we then play a board game.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-GB" style="font-weight: bold;">New This Year</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">This year we have many things planned such as cake tasting trips and events that are sure to be great fun.
