<h3><strong><u>JOGGING</u></strong></h3><p>Hey guys! Jogging is a relaxed society open to all abilities, and offers a great opportunity to get outside and get a bit of exercise, without being too strenuous! (This is why we're 'jogging soc', not 'running club'!) </p><p>We&nbsp;meet&nbsp;twice&nbsp;a week on a Tuesday and&nbsp;Thursday evening at 7 or 7:30pm, just outside Butler Bar, so come along and get a breath of fresh air after a long day of lectures. We are also hoping to start some jogs from the Students' Union so that Livers Out can join us more easily! </p><p>We've got a facebook group, so please join as we'll be posting on there regarding the details of our jogs! </p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/395321007208388/?fref=ts">https://www.facebook.com/#!/groups/395321007208388/?fref=ts</a></p><p>Hope to see some keen joggers out there! </p><p>:)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
