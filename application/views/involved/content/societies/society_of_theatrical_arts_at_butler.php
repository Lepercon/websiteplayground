If you're a serious thespian or simply known by your friends as bit of a drama queen, then STAB has something for you: from the ever popular and unique-in-Durham Murder Mystery Formal, through the myriad Christmas performances to the full-length annual production. In recent years we&rsquo;ve tackled pieces as diverse as J. B. Priestley&rsquo;s brooding &lsquo;An Inspector Calls&rsquo;, Enda Walsh&rsquo;s web-based &lsquo;Chatroom&rsquo;, a musical adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett's 'The Secret Garden' and the Shakespearean classic&nbsp; 'The Winter's Tale'. If DST daunts you, or you want to be involved but just don&rsquo;t fancy the hike into town then get in touch!</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;"><strong><em>If you'd like more information on STAB or drama at Durham in general then please don't hesitate to get in contact.</em></strong></span><img style="margin: 10px auto; display: block;" src="http://www.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/application/views/involved/img/upload/030.jpg" alt="" /></p>
