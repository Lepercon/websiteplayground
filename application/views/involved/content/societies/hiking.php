This society is perfect for anyone looking to venture out and explore the often under-appreciated surroundings that Durham has to offer! (We may also try and go further afield this year if enough people express an interest, to the Lake District for example.) So whether you're an avid walker or just fancy a bit of fresh air and some exercise, come along! We may even stop for a drink at a cafe/pub/picnic along the way, we're very flexible and relaxed! &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal">Any abilities are welcome and whether you’re keen to commit to every hike planned or just fancy the odd walk, this club is adaptable and it’s completely up to you!<br /><br />We usually meet on Saturday/Sunday mornings; weather permitting.<br /></p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal">Please wear suitable clothing and shoes (hiking boots, wellies, you know the drill). <br /><br />Please contact us if you have any questions or join us on Facebook.<br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/170933426280907/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/170933426280907/</a></p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><br />Hopefully see you on the next hike! x</p><p style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><br /></p><img src="http://www.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/application/views/involved/img/upload/057.jpg" height="388" width="287">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="http://www.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/application/views/involved/img/upload/059.jpg" height="390" width="292"><br /><br /><br />
