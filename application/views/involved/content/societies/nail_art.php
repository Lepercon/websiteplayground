<h3>At Butler Nail Soc, we meet fortnightly in the JCR Lounge for a friendly and informal session of nail painting. Members can share techniques and ideas and relax - often with chocolate provided!</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>We also plan to do some charity nail painting around balls to raise money for Grace House, and help welfare during their relaxation campaigns.</h3><h3><br />Our Facebook group can be found here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/688533501160095/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/688533501160095/</a></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="http://community.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/application/views/involved/img/upload/080.jpg" alt="" /></p><h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>
