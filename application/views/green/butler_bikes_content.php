<p>Butler&rsquo;s own take on London&rsquo;s Boris Bikes scheme.&nbsp;Butler Bikes offers a brilliant environmentally friendly way to get around the city. Our Butler Bikes scheme is a bike rental service which allows our students to rent bikes for 24 hour periods, and in doing so promotes environmentally-friendly and sustainable practices by discouraging the use of cars.</p>
<p>We work in collaboration with &lsquo;RecykeYBike&rsquo;, a social enterprise based in Newcastle which repairs old bikes and sells them on, giving the profit to charities in Africa. Butler Green Committee collaborates with RecykeYBike to fix the bikes we receive as donations, again with the proceeds going to Africa. As such, the Butler Bikes scheme has extensive environmental and charitable benefits, not only for the Durham community, but also further afield.</p>
<p>Membership to the Butler Bikes scheme is currently &pound;15 for a whole year. Keys to the bikes can be picked up fro the JCR office once your membership fees have been paid.</p>
