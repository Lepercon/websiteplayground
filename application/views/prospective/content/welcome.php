The collegiate system at Durham means you are a part of your college's community for the entire time you are here, and beyond, and being a member of the JCR (Junior Common Room) is a massive part of that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For more of an introduction to Butler College, watch our 2014 frep team video:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="iframe src=" width="626" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">&lt;/iframe&gt;">&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3QVZPxtxOiM?list=UUYo16wmal5gkYQpOYBUPPvw" width="626" height="352" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any questions about life at Butler then feel free to get in touch by emailing Hattie Pridmore (<a href="http://community.dur.ac.uk/butler.jcr/contact/1155">contact</a>)</p><p>Follow this link to see our College video, aimed at prospective students: <a class="no-jsify" href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/butler.college/gallery/">http://www.dur.ac.uk/butler.college/gallery/</a></p>
